 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Paras Jaina final year undergraduate student at Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani, India. I am passionate about Engineering and Mathematics and perpetually interested in the integration of technology with our daily lives. I am highly fascinated by the fields of Biometrics, Forecasting, Data Science, Machine Learning, Algorithms, Deep Learning, Big Data, and NLP with a history of Research & Development. I have worked at various organizations, India and abroad, such as CEERI Pilani and ETU-LETI, St. Petersburg, and have contributed to several research projects. When I am not engrossed in academic activities, I like to play Tennis and Guitar.
 
 Feel Free to go through my projects.
